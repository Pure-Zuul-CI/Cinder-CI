A possible replacement is to add a pyproject.toml or enable --use-pep517, and use setuptools >= 64. If the resulting installation is not behaving as expected, try using --config-settings editable_mode=compat. Please consult the setuptools documentation for more information.

2025-07-31 00:16:17.825999 | controller |   DEPRECATION: Building 'testresources' using the legacy setup.py bdist_wheel mechanism, which will be removed in a future version. pip 25.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to use the standardized build interface by setting the `--use-pep517` option, (possibly combined with `--no-build-isolation`), or adding a `pyproject.toml` file to the source tree of 'testresources'. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6334

2025-07-31 00:16:49.736924 | controller |   DEPRECATION: Legacy editable install of cinder==26.1.0.dev76 from file:///opt/stack/cinder (setup.py develop) is deprecated. pip 25.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to add a pyproject.toml or enable --use-pep517, and use setuptools >= 64. If the resulting installation is not behaving as expected, try using --config-settings editable_mode=compat. Please consult the setuptools documentation for more information. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11457

2025-07-31 00:23:38.432406 | controller | • A unit may be started when needed via activation (socket, path, timer,

2025-07-31 00:23:38.432413 | controller | • In case of template units, the unit is meant to be enabled with some

A possible replacement is to add a pyproject.toml or enable --use-pep517, and use setuptools >= 64. If the resulting installation is not behaving as expected, try using --config-settings editable_mode=compat. Please consult the setuptools documentation for more information.
